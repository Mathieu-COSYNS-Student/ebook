"A reliable connection oriented transport places a 32 bits sequence number"
" inside the segment header to number the segments. This sequence number "
"is incremented for each data segment. The connection starts as shown in "
"the figure below :"

"Continue the connection so that `Host B` sends `Hello` as data and `Host "
"A` replies by sending `Pleased to meet you`. After having received the "
"response, `Host B` closes the connection gracefully and `Host A` does the"
" same. Discuss on the state that needs to be maintained inside each host."

"A transport connection that provides a message-mode service has been "
"active for some time and all data has been exchanged and acknowledged in "
"both directions. As in the exercise above, the sequence number is "
"incremented after the transmission of each segment. At this time, `Host "
"A` sends two DATA segments as shown in the figure below."

"Consider a reliable connection-oriented transport protocol that provides "
"the bytestream service. In this transport protocol, the sequence number "
"that is placed inside each DATA segment reflects the position of the "
"bytes in the bytestream. Considering the connection shown below, provide "
"the DATA segments that are sent by `Host A` in response to the "
"`DATA.request`, assuming that one segment is sent for each "
"`DATA.request`."

"Same question as above, but consider now that the transport protocol "
"tries to send large DATA segments whenever possible. For this exercise, "
"we consider that a DATA segment can contain up to 8 bytes of data in the "
"payload. Do not forget to show the acknowledgments in your answer."
