"To understand the operation of Medium Access Control algorithms, it is "
"often interesting to use a geometric representation of the transmission "
"of frames on a shared medium. This representation is suitable if the "
"communicating devices are attached to a single cable. Consider a simple "
"scenario with a host connected at one end of a cable. For simplicity, let"
" us consider a cable that has a length of one kilometer. Let us also "
"consider that the propagation delay of the electrical signal is five "
"microseconds per kilometer. The figure below shows the transmission of a "
"2000 bits frame at 100 Mbps by host A on the cable."

"If the transmitting host is located at another position on the shared "
"medium than one of the edges, then the geometrical pattern that "
"represents the transmission of a frame is slightly different. If the "
"transmitting host is placed in the middle of the cable, then the signal "
"is transmitted in both directions on the cable. The figure below shows "
"the transmission of one 100 bits frame at 100 Mbps by host C on the same "
"cable."
